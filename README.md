## My Personal Website

This my personal website that contains my portfolio, links to various resources where you will find out more about me, and some blog posts.

It has google analytics setup and gulp installation is required for local dev with current setup.

Forestry is the CMS service I use for more convenient deployment of blog posts from a better text editing environment.
