## The Internet and Engineering

Here is a list of ideas for the Internet project.

Most of these ideas revolve around the concepts, features, and parts of the Internet that are _hidden, clandestine, or go unnoticed by_ most of the users.

### Disposal of Personal Data

* **Rebuild : Ephemeral Internet**
  * New Rule :  
    Every content, packet that is delivered to another entity on the internet only belongs to the new owner, so sender is left with nothing, and the content is distributed among the "receivers" So we have a clear sense of who owns what data.
  * Fun activity : Send out pieces of random image on the internet to everybody -> Then from human interaction, we try to put the pieces together. (bringing back human interaction and a sense of community while forcing the disposal of data on the sender's side).
* **Data Shredder:**
  * Destroy personal data on the internet "physically"
  * Inspirations from [Shredder]() by Mark Napier
  * Not quite sure which personal data to play with. Perhaps a mixture of "shredder"(visual effect) and "[friend-fracker]()"(concept) might be interesting?
* **Maps : Where is our personal data physically stored?**
  * Collect all the known data centers and plot them on google maps
  * (risky) We don't know which companies rely on which data centers and research needs to be done to make this cool (probably over-scoped for this project)

### Things that don't Get Much Attention
