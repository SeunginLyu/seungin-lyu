_"Forgot Your Password?"_ a series of books that contain a few gigabytes of decrypted passwords from the 2012 LinkedIn user database leak incident. It is a physical archive of  past event, it is an artist expression that encapsulates Aram Bartholl's weaving of his thoughts on passwords and the incident, and more literally, it is a question Aram is throwing at us, the audience. 

"Forgot Your Password?" 

I like how this title changes our conception of this work, from a seemingly monotonous list of passwords to suddenly a curious collection of perhaps the most sensitive personal information of people living the digital age (which, of course, includes me!). It implicitly evokes this provocative tone that I'm no exception to such incidents and that my passwords are just not well-protected as that of the others. 

What makes the message even more effective is the cold,  monotonous, static, black-and-white, yet succinct style of this piece. Coloring the book mostly pure white and leaving the text black feels almost apathetic as if the author was trying to distant himself from the piece. The general tone of the style is almost overwhelming due to its strong contrast, but the overwhelmingness does add some weight to the content of this book.

I love the fact that this piece naturally leads to a series of interesting questions to think about.

\- What doesn't work?

the intention is not clear (no sense of direction)  
so what should I do? raise awareness? fear that the thing is out to get me?

(like a pragmatic solution)

\- What could make it stronger, and what is adding to or taking away from its impact?
