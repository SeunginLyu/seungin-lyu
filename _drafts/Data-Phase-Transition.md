* Representations of various phenomena
* Contextual collections of things
* Translation of the world into human-defined objects

Today, we are surrounded by an unprecedented mass of data, yet people still have distinctively varying views on what "data" exactly means. This above list is my attempt to come up with a reasonable description of what data is, but I'm sure there are million other ways to explain it differently. 

> "What is data, like, what is it?"

By going through _Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation_ by Laura Kurgan and _Objectivity_ by Lorraine Daston,Peter Galison, I developed a mental model of data that somewhat weaves together the complexities of data such as objectivity, standards, interpretations and etc.

I see data as **frozen snippets of encrypted human stories**. 

They are **encrypted** because often times there are hidden secrets that are impossible to be discovered unless we are "provided" the keys to unveil them. The encrypted secretes include :

* Who/what collected the data?
* Who chose to produce the data?
* When and where was the data captured?

While the general public indulges in the wide availability of open data nowadays (i.e Google Earth photos, Wikipedia, etc.), we should still remark that these datasets seldom come packaged with the secrets and stories of their origins. It is actually trivial that unique stories should exist behind all datasets because real "people" have taken efforts to create them. Nonetheless, unless we go actively hunt for the keys to these datasets (that might not even exist), we are still left with partially encrypted datasets that are subject to subjective inferences based on the relatively small portion of the story that has been decrypted for us. 

Thus it is no surprise that people propose a wide spectrum of interpretations given the same datasets. Provided limited knowledge, the directions of these interpretations are inevitably biased with individual prior knowledge, and we should acknowledge that the "trustworthiness" of such inferences are applicable only within the  

Moreover, I call data **frozen snippets** because we only see the frozen phase of data which in fact goes through phase transitions. 

  
If all data is interpreted, as Kurgan (and some of you) say, what are datasets really tell us? How do we know when and how we can trust a dataset, and is there a standard rule for this?

* What are the different types of truth that a dataset can have? Can data reflect a number of different realities at once?
