* Representations of various phenomena
* Contextual collections of things
* Translation of the world into human-defined objects

Today, we are surrounded by an unprecedented mass of data, yet people still have distinctively varying views on what "data" exactly means. This above list is my attempt to come up with a reasonable description of what data is, but I'm sure there are million other ways to explain it differently. 

> "What is data, like, what is it?"

By going through _Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation_ by Laura Kurgan and _Objectivity_ by Lorraine Daston,Peter Galison, I developed a mental model of data that explains why the concept of data still feels cloudy and somewhat vague.

I see data as frozen snippets of encrypted human stories. 

They are encrypted because often times there are hidden secrets that are impossible to be discovered unless we are "provided" the keys to unveil them. 

  
If all data is interpreted, as Kurgan (and some of you) say, what are datasets really tell us? How do we know when and how we can trust a dataset, and is there a standard rule for this?

* What are the different types of truth that a dataset can have? Can data reflect a number of different realities at once?
