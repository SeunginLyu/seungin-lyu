After reading these articles, I kept asking myself

> "What does it mean to use data about individuals to create a unique representative mapping of them?"

If we think about China's all-seeing social credit score system, we could abstract the system down to a simple function that takes a sequence of human behaviors and outputs a number after going through its internal algorithm. 

For example, 

    Input : {
    			{behavior:"cheated in game",time:"09/10/18"}
                {behavior:"harmed two neighbors",time:"09/10/18"}
                {behavior:"earned $100",time:"09/10/18"}
                {behavior:"protested against government",time:"09/10/18"}
                {behavior:"destroyed public property",time:"09/10/18"}
    		}
     Output : 123
     

So this is a mapping from a sequence of behaviors to a credit score. In the end, we are left with no details but with an abstraction of data that can't be reversed back to its original form. (X -> Y is possible, but Y->X is impossible even if we know the internal algorithm!)

Similarly,
