This post is my short response to the following readings

* "[Sorry, We Have No Imagery Here](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/investigating-censored-spots-on-google-earth)", Meg Van Huygen
* The first chapter of James Scott's [Seeing Like A State](https://libcom.org/files/Seeing%20Like%20a%20State%20-%20James%20C.%20Scott.pdf) (pages 11- 52).

When I saw the satelite images (censored, hidden, blurred) from Meg Van Huygen's article, I was immediately reminded of the Korean Demelitarized Zone between North and South Korea. It's a buffer zone that stretches about 160 miles long and is about 2.5 miles wide. This special area remained untouched by humans after the Korean War that lasted from 1950-1953, but unlike its name "Demiltarized Zone", the area is full of landmines and civilian access highly restricted.   
  
Because of the area's sensitivity in terms of military, political and diplomatic significance, it is near impossible to find a detailed map of the DMZ. Especially in Korean maps powered by local tech companies like Kakao and Naver, the area is represented with plain gray-ish layer that only displays the very minimum road information. Google Maps also doesn't do a good job of representing this area. I would guess the South Korean government has asked many map vendors to remove this area from their maps. I find this somewhat ironic  
  
I decided to make my own map of this area, since I spent my 2 years serving in the South Korean Army under UN Security Command prior to coming to Olin for college education. You can find my version [here](https://seungin-lyu.com/assets/basic-vector-map.html). I used geojson.io to indicate some interesting areas and routes. Then I used Mapbox GL JS and its Compare plugin to put an ordinary map and a satelite map of the Korean Demilitarized Zone.
