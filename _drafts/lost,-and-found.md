I work for Olin College Library, a magical space where creativity and collaboration is encouraged. If you are shocked by this paradoxical description of a library, I recommend checking out our [website](http://library.olin.edu/)! (but this post isn't really about the library).

We occasionally send out HelpYou emails to remind people that there are "interesting stuff" in the lost and found cabinet located right next to the entrance.
