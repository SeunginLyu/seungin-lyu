    title: "AI + Inclusion: The Future of City Navigation"
    excerpt: Technology is growing faster than we have ever seen, but it is not always accessible to people in overlooked communities, such as people who are blind or have low vision. Olin College Microsoft SCOPE team leveraged open data sets and Microsoft Cognitive Services to address some of the challenges these individuals face when navigating in a city. The team designed a new application for and with the blind and visually impaired community, allowing users to explore areas virtually and get information relevant to them, before visiting in person.
