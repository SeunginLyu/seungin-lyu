    title: "AI + Inclusion: The Future of City Navigation"
    excerpt: Technology is growing faster than we have ever seen, but it is not always accessible to people in overlooked communities, such as people who are blind or have low vision. Olin College Microsoft SCOPE team leveraged open data sets and Microsoft Cognitive Services to address some of the challenges these individuals face when navigating in a city. The team designed a new application for and with the blind and visually impaired community, allowing users to explore areas virtually and get information relevant to them, before visiting in person.

    title: "Musical Cane Game"
    excerpt: An orientation and mobility learning game that empoweres an O&M instructor by motivating students with sounds, music, and beep noises during cane tutorials. This project has been initiated and maintained by Paul's students (Occam Lab, TAD). Eric Jerman from Perkins School for the Blind is our primary partner for this project. He works with students at Perkins School for the Blind to help them develop their orientation and mobility skills. Orientation and Mobility refers to a set of skills that consists of knowing where you are in an environment, understanding how to navigate to a place of interest, and how to move about safely within an environment.While these skills are vital to the independence of Ericâ€™s students, their motivation to practice these skills is often low. In contrast, other elements of the Perkins curriculum (e.g., music therapy) tend to be met with more excitement and commitment. Eric is interested in developing strategies for making his sessions more engaging and effective through the use of the concept of gamified learning, whereby elements of game design are brought to an educational context.
