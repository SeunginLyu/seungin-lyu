After reading these articles, I kept asking myself

> "What does it mean to use personal data to create a unique representative mapping of individuals?"

If we think about China's all-seeing social credit score system, we could abstract the system down to a simple function that takes a sequence of human behaviors and outputs a number after going through its internal algorithm.

For example,

    Input :
    {behavior:"cheated in game",time:"09/10/18"},
    {behavior:"harmed two neighbors",time:"09/10/18"},
    {behavior:"earned $100",time:"09/10/18"},
    {behavior:"protested against government",time:"09/10/18"},
    {behavior:"destroyed public property",time:"09/10/18"},

    Output : 123

So this is a mapping from a sequence of behaviors to a credit score. In the end, we are left with no details but with an abstraction of data that can't be reversed back to its original form. (X -> Y is possible, but Y->X is impossible even if we know the internal algorithm!)

The QR code is also a type of abstraction and a mapping of personal information (account number, or ID number) to a representation (QR Code). It's interesting that QR code serves as a means of identification that people feel more comfortable sharing with strangers because the private personal data is encapsulated in the representation.

I feel motivated to dig deeper into this notion of creating identification from personal data and the subtle implications behind this idea.

**Bookmarks** (for internet browsing) interest me because they form a unique collection of an individual's interests, history, and life style. I think of them as our web finger prints that might potentially serve as an identification when abstracted. They are even more interesting because they are super **private. (So the main challenge would be.. how do I collect people's bookmarks?)** So I did a little bit of hunch hunting.

I arrived at a potential idea of converting raw bookmarks texts into Identicons, just like the default profile image we see on services like Github and Wordpress. Below are some links to websites that I found helpful brainstorming ideas for bookmarks and Identicons.

While I'm left with a lot more exploration to further dive into this topic, I'm looking forward to transformation of bookmarks to Identicons!

**Further things to think about** :

* What algorithm am I going to use as the "hash" function?
* What form of bookmarks data am I going to use? (Favicon images, bookmarks html export, raw texts, titles)
* What context and form should I provide to the audience?
* What style makes sense?
* How am I going to gather bookmark data? (Survey? Ask friends? Helpme email?)
