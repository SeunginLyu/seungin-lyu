I have been working on a program that generates "bookmarkticons" based on the bookmarks text the user provides. For the first pass prototype, I've overlaid various favicon images using a SHA hash and a simple modulus algorithm. This first pass model was heavily inspired and based on the "Robohash" code ([https://robohash.org/](https://robohash.org/ "https://robohash.org/"))
