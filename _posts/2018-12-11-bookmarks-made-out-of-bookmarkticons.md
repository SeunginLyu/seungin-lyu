My hunch for this project was my bookmarks. Not the bookmarks we use to indicate the last page you read on a paper book but those that the list of shortcuts to websites on our web browsers. I have always been fascinated by the design efforts that go into creating favicons, and I envisioned an algorithm that would turn a person's bookmarks into a QR code / Identicon (from Github) looking images from a collage of favicons that are relevant to that specific person's bookmarks export. 

I wanted to do this project because random hash images like QR-Code and Identicons lack human personalities in that they do not encapsulate any personal traits, unique aspects, or interesting facts about the person they identify. I wanted to create an image that somewhat encapsulates the sensitivity and the subtle implication bookmarks because they tell a story about people's interests, internet habits, life-styles, even sometimes more private information like political opinions. What's even more interesting is that people rarely get to see what other people have on their bookmarks list. What if people can share their bookmarks? What if they can do so without getting concerned about their privacy?

How did you do it?

What did you end up with as a final piece?

What did you learn?
