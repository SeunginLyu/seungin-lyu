Here are some of the response I got from the previous feedback session.

* What is the message? Is this just an amalgamation of a person as an icon based on their bookmarks?
* It feels random and tangential to the bookmarks that got fed into the algorithm because the hash is randomly choosing favicons that aren't relevant to the bookmarks.
* There's still something "vague" about this project.

I thought about these points and came to the conclusion that I share the same feelings about my own work.
