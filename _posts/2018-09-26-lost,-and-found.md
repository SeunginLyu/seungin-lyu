## Story

I work at Olin College Library, a magical space where creativity and collaboration is encouraged. If you are somewhat shocked by this seemingly paradoxical description of a library, I recommend checking out our [website](http://library.olin.edu/)! (but this post isn't really about the library).

We occasionally send out HelpYou emails to remind the community of the "interesting things" in the lost and found cabinet located right next to the library entrance. You would think that most of these lost items would find home shortly after the email is sent out, but in reality, I see the same sets of items over and over again. They are just forgotten after all.

When I was told to do a project that is in a context similar to that of [_Forgot Your Password_](https://arambartholl.com/forgot-your-password/)_?_ by Aram Bartholl, I felt deeply engaged by this notion of "presenting to an audience a contextual collection of forgotten (or lost) personal belongings". The X-Factor of _Forgot Your Password?,_ to me, was the manner in which the artist approached the audience. The title provokes the audience by softly implying that "your pass words might be here". I 

I created "_Lost, and Found?",_ a photo catalog of individual items from the lost and found cabinet in September, 2018.

To DOs;

* how did you think about how to approach doing this?
* What did you end up with as a final piece?
* In which ways is your piece different from the original
* and which aspects were you focused on changing or replicating?

Some Notes

\- Text? Black and White Images? vs HelpMe Emails

\- Text -> Image?

\- forgotten -> collected (by me)-> reborn

\- maybe a little bit of ambiguity so people canâ€™t just figure out what exactly the item is before they actually come check things out?

\- This is not really a leak of personal information, but how is this similar? (weak connection)

\- cameras, clothes, very personal objects
