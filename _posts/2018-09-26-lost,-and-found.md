## Story

I work at Olin College Library, a magical community space filled with creativity and collaboration. If you are somewhat shocked by this seemingly paradoxical description of a library, I recommend checking out our [website](http://library.olin.edu/)! (but this post isn't really about the library).

We occasionally send out HelpYou emails to remind the community of the "interesting things" in the lost and found cabinet located right next to the library entrance. You would think that most of these lost items would find home shortly after the email is sent out, but in reality, I see the same sets of items over and over again. They are just forgotten after all.

When I was told to do a project similar to [_Forgot Your Password_](https://arambartholl.com/forgot-your-password/)_?_ by Aram Bartholl, I felt deeply engaged by this notion of "presenting to an audience a contextual collection of forgotten (or lost) personal belongings". The X-Factor of _Forgot Your Password?,_ to me, was the manner in which the artist approached the audience. The title provokes the audience by softly implying that "your passwords might be here" which naturally leads to a deep dive contemplation of the meanings, implications of passwords and what it means to expose them to the public. I also paid attention to the unique medium the artist chose to use. why would an artist create 8 volumes of hard cover books only to archive a few gigabytes of password? 

In response to a series of other questions that followed, I created "_Lost, and Found?",_ a photo catalog of 46 lost items from Olin College Library. It is an homage of _Forgot Your Password?_ but also my attempt to archive a unique moment the library, the physical space and the community.  

To DOs;

* What did you end up with as a final piece?
* In which ways is your piece different from the original
* and which aspects were you focused on changing or replicating?

Some Notes

\- Text -> Image?

\- forgotten -> collected (by me)-> reborn

\- maybe a little bit of ambiguity so people canâ€™t just figure out what exactly the item is before they actually come check things out?

\- This is not really a leak of personal information, but how is this similar? (weak connection)

\- cameras, clothes, very personal objects
